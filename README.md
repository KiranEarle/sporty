Project: Sporty tech task

# Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
# Run to install dependence's
npm install
# or
yarn

# To run locally on http://localhost:3000
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

Runtime: Node@22.14.0

```bash
# has an .nvmrc file with the version there, run:
nvm use
```

# Technical decisions

The app is built using:

### NextJS

- Easy to build SSR single page applications
- It is a React framework
- Provides a lot of inbuilt features that make developing and deploying the application easy.

### React

- UI component library (obviously as part of NextJS).

### Styling

Because it was a small application I just went with CSS Modules. The reason for this is:

- Its a smaller app
- I wanted to showcase that I understand how to use CSS with without preprocessors.
- FYI, I have used Styled components, Tailwind and SCSS in other projects

### AI

Chat-GPT Only here and there for some styling queries.
